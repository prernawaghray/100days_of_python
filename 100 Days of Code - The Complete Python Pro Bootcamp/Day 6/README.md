## üóÇÔ∏è Exercises and Projects

### Practice Exercises:
1. **[Functions](./Functions/)** - Basic function definition and calling
2. **Reeborg's World Challenges** - Visual programming puzzles using functions

### Main Project:
ü§ñ **Karel/Reeborg's World Challenges** - Solve maze and obstacle challenges using functions and logical thinking

## üéÆ Karel/Reeborg's World

Day 6 uses Karel the Robot (implemented as Reeborg's World) to teach functions in a visual, interactive way:

### Karel's World Features:
- Visual grid-based environment
- Limited set of commands (move, turn, pick up, put down)
- Obstacles and goals to navigate
- Function-based problem solving

### Available Commands:
- `move()` - Move forward one step
- `turn_left()` - Turn 90 degrees left
- `pick_beeper()` - Pick up a beeper/token
- `put_beeper()` - Put down a beeper/token
- `front_is_clear()` - Check if path ahead is clear
- `wall_in_front()` - Check if there's a wall ahead
- `beepers_present()` - Check if beepers are at current location

### Sample Challenges:
- Navigate through mazes
- Collect all beepers in a world
- Build walls or patterns
- Solve puzzles with obstacles

## üß† Key Programming Concepts

### Basic Function Definition
```python
# Define a function
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
    print("Welcome to Python!")

# Call the function
greet()  # Executes the function
```

### Functions for Code Reusability
```python
# Without functions (repetitive)
print("Step 1: Prepare ingredients")
print("Step 2: Mix ingredients")
print("Step 3: Cook")
print("Step 1: Prepare ingredients")
print("Step 2: Mix ingredients")
print("Step 3: Cook")

# With functions (reusable)
def make_recipe():
    print("Step 1: Prepare ingredients")
    print("Step 2: Mix ingredients")
    print("Step 3: Cook")

make_recipe()  # First meal
make_recipe()  # Second meal
```

### Karel Function Examples
```python
# Create a function to turn right (using turn_left)
def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

# Create a function to turn around
def turn_around():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

# Use the functions
move()
turn_right()
move()
turn_around()
```

### Complex Karel Functions
```python
# Function to jump over a hurdle
def jump():
    turn_left()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_right()
    move()
    turn_left()

# Function to collect all beepers in a line
def collect_beepers():
    while beepers_present():
        pick_beeper()
```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 6, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Define custom functions using `def`
- ‚úÖ Call functions and understand execution flow
- ‚úÖ Use functions to eliminate code repetition
- ‚úÖ Break down complex problems into smaller functions
- ‚úÖ Apply logical thinking to solve visual puzzles
- ‚úÖ Understand the importance of code organization
- ‚úÖ Create reusable code components
- ‚úÖ Think algorithmically about problem-solving

## üîß Python Concepts Introduced

### Function Syntax
```python
# Basic function structure
def function_name():
    # Function body (indented)
    print("This is inside the function")
    # More code here

# Function call
function_name()
```

### Function Best Practices
```python
# Good function names (descriptive)
def calculate_area():
    pass

def send_email():
    pass

def validate_input():
    pass

# Poor function names (not descriptive)
def func1():
    pass

def do_stuff():
    pass
```

### Nested Function Calls
```python
def step_forward():
    move()

def turn_right():
    turn_left()
    turn_left()
    turn_left()

def move_and_turn():
    step_forward()  # Calling another function
    turn_right()    # Calling another function
```

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive function names
2. **Single Purpose**: Each function should do one thing well
3. **Consistent Indentation**: Keep function body properly indented
4. **Test Functions**: Test each function individually before combining
5. **Plan First**: Think about what functions you need before coding

## üèÜ Challenges

Try these additional challenges to reinforce your learning:

1. **Easy**: Create functions for common mathematical operations
2. **Medium**: Build a text-based drawing program using functions
3. **Hard**: Create a function library for common string operations
4. **Expert**: Design a simple game using only functions

## üîç Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting Parentheses**: Functions need `()` to be called
2. **Indentation Errors**: Function body must be indented
3. **Calling Before Defining**: Define functions before calling them
4. **Infinite Recursion**: Be careful with functions calling themselves
5. **Poor Naming**: Use descriptive names, not generic ones

## üìñ Key Concepts and Keywords

### Function Keywords:
- `def` - Define a function
- `return` - Return a value (covered in Day 10)
- `pass` - Placeholder for empty functions

### Karel/Reeborg Commands:
- `move()` - Move forward
- `turn_left()` - Turn left 90 degrees
- `pick_beeper()` - Pick up object
- `put_beeper()` - Put down object
- `front_is_clear()` - Check if path is clear
- `wall_in_front()` - Check for wall
- `beepers_present()` - Check for beepers

### Programming Principles:
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself
- **Modularity**: Break code into small, manageable pieces
- **Abstraction**: Hide complex details behind simple function names
