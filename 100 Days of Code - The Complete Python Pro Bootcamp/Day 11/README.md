# Day 11: The Blackjack Capstone Project ‚ô†Ô∏è

Day 11 is a capstone project day that brings together all the concepts learned in the first 10 days to build a complete Blackjack card game.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Capstone Project Methodology
- Planning complex projects step by step
- Breaking down requirements into manageable tasks
- Combining multiple programming concepts
- Testing and debugging larger programs

### 2. Game Logic Implementation
- Card game rules and mechanics
- Score calculation and comparison
- Win/lose condition handling
- User interaction and game flow

### 3. Advanced Problem Solving
- Handling edge cases and special scenarios
- Managing game state and player actions
- Creating engaging user experiences
- Code organization for complex projects

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### Main Project:
üÉè **[Blackjack Game](./task/)** - Complete implementation of the classic card game with all standard rules

## üéÆ Blackjack Game Project

The Day 11 capstone project is a fully functional Blackjack game that:
- Implements all standard Blackjack rules
- Handles card dealing and score calculation
- Manages Ace values (1 or 11) automatically
- Includes dealer AI behavior
- Provides clear game feedback and results

### Game Features:
- **Standard Rules**: Follow official Blackjack gameplay
- **Card Management**: Proper card dealing and deck handling
- **Score Calculation**: Automatic score tracking with Ace handling
- **Dealer AI**: Computer dealer follows standard rules
- **Win Conditions**: All standard win/lose/draw scenarios
- **User Interface**: Clear prompts and game state display

### Blackjack Rules Implemented:
- Player and dealer each get 2 initial cards
- Player can "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep current hand)
- Dealer must hit on 16 or below, stand on 17 or above
- Aces count as 11, but become 1 if hand would bust
- Blackjack (21 with 2 cards) beats regular 21
- Bust (over 21) results in immediate loss

### Sample Game Flow:
```
Welcome to Blackjack!

Your cards: [10, 5], current score: 15
Computer's first card: 7

Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: y

Your cards: [10, 5, 4], current score: 19
Computer's first card: 7

Type 'y' to get another card, type 'n' to pass: n

Your final hand: [10, 5, 4], final score: 19
Computer's final hand: [7, 10, 6], final score: 23
Opponent went over. You win! üòÉ
```

## üß† Key Programming Concepts Applied

### Game State Management
```python
# Managing player and dealer hands
player_cards = []
computer_cards = []
is_game_over = False

# Game loop structure
while not is_game_over:
    # Player actions
    # Check win conditions
    # Update game state
```

### Card and Score Logic
```python
def deal_card():
    """Returns a random card from the deck."""
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    card = random.choice(cards)
    return card

def calculate_score(cards):
    """Calculate the score of a hand, handling Aces appropriately."""
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0  # Blackjack
    
    if 11 in cards and sum(cards) > 21:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    
    return sum(cards)
```

### Game Logic Flow
```python
def compare(user_score, computer_score):
    """Compare scores and determine winner."""
    if user_score > 21 and computer_score > 21:
        return "You went over. You lose üò§"
    
    if user_score == computer_score:
        return "Draw üôÉ"
    elif computer_score == 0:
        return "Lose, opponent has Blackjack üò±"
    elif user_score == 0:
        return "Win with a Blackjack üòé"
    elif user_score > 21:
        return "You went over. You lose üò≠"
    elif computer_score > 21:
        return "Opponent went over. You win üòÅ"
    elif user_score > computer_score:
        return "You win üòÉ"
    else:
        return "You lose üò§"
```

    if user_score == 0 or computer_score == 0 or user_score > 21:
        is_game_over = True
    return is_game_over

# List manipulation and random selection
def deal_initial_cards():
    for _ in range(2):
        user_cards.append(deal_card())
        computer_cards.append(deal_card())

# Function composition
def play_game():
    user_cards = []
    computer_cards = []
    
    deal_initial_cards()
    
    while not is_game_over:
        user_score = calculate_score(user_cards)
        computer_score = calculate_score(computer_cards)
        
        display_current_state(user_cards, computer_cards, user_score)
        
        if check_game_over(user_score, computer_score):
            break
            
        handle_player_turn(user_cards)
    
    handle_dealer_turn(computer_cards)

```

## üí° Project Development Tips

1. **Plan First**: Write out the game flow before coding
2. **Start Simple**: Implement basic functionality first
3. **Test Frequently**: Test each function as you build it
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider all possible game scenarios
5. **Refactor**: Improve code organization as you go

## üèÜ Challenges and Extensions

Once you complete the basic game, try these enhancements:

1. **Easy**: Add betting system with chips
2. **Medium**: Implement multiple decks and card counting prevention
3. **Hard**: Add split and double down options
4. **Expert**: Create a GUI version using Tkinter

## üîç Common Implementation Challenges

1. **Ace Handling**: Managing Ace values (1 vs 11) correctly
2. **Blackjack Detection**: Distinguishing Blackjack from regular 21
3. **Dealer Logic**: Implementing proper dealer hit/stand rules
4. **Game Flow**: Managing when the game should end
5. **Score Comparison**: Handling all possible win/lose scenarios

## üìñ Key Game Development Concepts

### Game Loop Pattern:
```python
# Standard game loop structure
def play_game():
    # Initialize game state
    setup_game()
    
    # Main game loop
    while not game_over:
        # Get player input
        # Update game state
        # Check win conditions
        # Display current state
    
    # End game
    display_results()
```
