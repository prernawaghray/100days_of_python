### 2. Type Error, Checking and Conversion
- Understanding type errors and how to fix them
- Using `type()` to check data types
- Converting between data types with `int()`, `float()`, `str()`
- Type casting and when to use it

### 3. Mathematical Operations
- Basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)
- Integer division `//` and modulo `%`
- Exponentiation `**`

### 4. Number Manipulation and F-Strings
- Rounding numbers with `round()`
- Floor division and ceiling operations
- String formatting with f-strings
- Mathematical functions and shortcuts

## üóÇÔ∏è Exercises and Projects

### Practice Exercises:
1. **[Data Types](./Data%20Types/)** - Learn about different Python data types
2. **[Type Error, Checking and Conversion](./Type%20Error,%20Checking%20and%20Conversion/)** - Handle type errors and conversions
3. **[Mathematical Operations](./Mathematical%20Operations/)** - Perform calculations in Python
4. **[Number Manipulation](./Number%20Manipulation/)** - Work with numbers and formatting

### Main Project:
üí∞ **[Tip Calculator Project](./Tip%20Calculator%20Project/)** - Calculate tips and split bills among friends

## üéÆ Tip Calculator Project

The Day 2 capstone project is a practical tip calculator that:
- Calculates the total bill including tip
- Splits the bill among multiple people
- Handles different tip percentages
- Formats the output to show currency properly

### Project Requirements:
- Ask for the total bill amount
- Ask for the tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%)
- Ask for the number of people to split the bill
- Calculate and display each person's share

### Sample Interaction:
```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $124.56
How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
How many people to split the bill? 7
Each person should pay: $19.93
```

## üß† Key Programming Concepts

### Data Type Identification
```python
# Check data types
print(type("Hello"))     # <class 'str'>
print(type(123))         # <class 'int'>
print(type(3.14))        # <class 'float'>
print(type(True))        # <class 'bool'>
```

### Type Conversion
```python
# Converting between types
age = input("What's your age? ")  # Returns string
age = int(age)                    # Convert to integer
print(f"You are {age} years old")
```

### Mathematical Operations
```python
# Basic arithmetic
result = 10 + 5    # Addition: 15
result = 10 - 3    # Subtraction: 7
result = 4 * 6     # Multiplication: 24
result = 15 / 3    # Division: 5.0 (always returns float)
result = 15 // 4   # Floor division: 3
result = 15 % 4    # Modulo: 3
result = 2 ** 3    # Exponentiation: 8
```

### Number Formatting
```python
# Rounding numbers
price = 19.9333333
rounded_price = round(price, 2)  # 19.93

# F-string formatting
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")
```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 2, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Identify different Python data types
- ‚úÖ Convert between data types when needed
- ‚úÖ Perform mathematical calculations in Python
- ‚úÖ Handle type errors effectively
- ‚úÖ Use f-strings for string formatting
- ‚úÖ Round numbers to specific decimal places
- ‚úÖ Build a practical calculator application

## üîß Python Concepts Introduced

### PEMDAS/BODMAS Order of Operations
```python
# Python follows mathematical order of operations
result = 3 + 5 * 2    # Result: 13 (not 16)
result = (3 + 5) * 2  # Result: 16 (parentheses first)
```

### String Subscripting
```python
# Access individual characters in strings
name = "Python"
print(name[0])  # P (first character)
print(name[-1]) # n (last character)
```

### Common Type Errors
```python
# This will cause a TypeError:
# print("Number of letters: " + len("Hello"))

# Correct way:
print("Number of letters: " + str(len("Hello")))
# Or using f-strings:
print(f"Number of letters: {len('Hello')}")
```

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

1. **Type Checking**: Use `type()` to check data types when debugging
2. **Input Validation**: Always convert `input()` to the appropriate type
3. **F-strings**: Use f-strings for cleaner string formatting
4. **Rounding**: Use `round()` for currency calculations
5. **Order of Operations**: Use parentheses to make calculations clear

## üèÜ Challenges

Try these additional challenges to reinforce your learning:

1. **Easy**: Create a BMI calculator that takes height and weight
2. **Medium**: Build a compound interest calculator
3. **Hard**: Create a unit converter (temperature, distance, weight)
4. **Expert**: Build a mortgage payment calculator

## üîç Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Forgetting Type Conversion**: `input()` always returns a string
2. **Integer vs Float Division**: `/` always returns float, `//` returns integer
3. **String Concatenation**: Can't directly add strings and numbers
4. **Precision Issues**: Floating-point arithmetic can be imprecise

## üìñ Key Functions and Methods

### Type Functions:
- `type(variable)` - Check the data type
- `int(value)` - Convert to integer
- `float(value)` - Convert to float
- `str(value)` - Convert to string

### Math Functions:
- `round(number, digits)` - Round to specified decimal places
- `abs(number)` - Absolute value
- `len(string)` - Length of string

### String Methods:
- `string[index]` - Access character at index
- `len(string)` - Get string length
