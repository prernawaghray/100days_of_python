## 🗂️ Exercises and Projects

### Practice Exercises:
1. **[Random Module](./Random%20Module/)** - Learn to generate random numbers and selections
2. **[Lists](./Lists/)** - Create and manipulate Python lists
3. **[IndexError](./IndexError/)** - Handle list indexing safely

### Main Project:
✂️ **[Rock Paper Scissors](./Rock%20Paper%20Scissors/)** - Classic game with random computer choices and score tracking

## 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Project

The Day 4 capstone project is the classic Rock Paper Scissors game that:
- Uses random selection for computer choices
- Implements game logic with conditional statements
- Stores choices in lists for easy access
- Displays ASCII art for visual appeal
- Determines winners based on game rules

### Game Features:
- Player chooses rock, paper, or scissors (0, 1, or 2)
- Computer makes random choice
- ASCII art displays both choices
- Game logic determines the winner
- Clear win/lose/draw messages

### Game Rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock
- Same choice = Draw

### Sample Game Flow:
```
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors.
> 0

You chose:
    _______
---'   ____)
      (_____)
      (_____)
      (____)
---.__(___)

Computer chose:
    _______
---'   ____)____
          ______)
       __________)
      (____)
---.__(___)

You win!
```

## 🧠 Key Programming Concepts

### Random Module Usage
```python
import random

# Generate random integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive)
dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6)

# Generate random float between 0 and 1
random_float = random.random()

# Choose random item from a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
random_fruit = random.choice(fruits)
```

### List Creation and Access
```python
# Creating lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed_list = ["hello", 42, True, 3.14]

# Accessing elements
first_fruit = fruits[0]    # "apple"
last_fruit = fruits[-1]    # "cherry" (negative indexing)

# Modifying elements
fruits[1] = "orange"       # Changes "banana" to "orange"
```

### List Methods and Operations
```python
# Adding elements
fruits.append("grape")     # Add to end
fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")   # Insert at specific position

# Removing elements
fruits.remove("apple")     # Remove by value
popped_fruit = fruits.pop() # Remove and return last element

# List information
length = len(fruits)       # Get list length
```

### Nested Lists
```python
# 2D list (list of lists)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

# Accessing nested elements
element = matrix[1][2]     # Gets 6 (row 1, column 2)
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 4, you should be able to:
- ✅ Import and use the random module
- ✅ Generate random numbers and make random selections
- ✅ Create and manipulate Python lists
- ✅ Access list elements using positive and negative indexing
- ✅ Avoid and handle IndexError exceptions
- ✅ Work with nested lists and 2D data structures
- ✅ Build games that use randomization
- ✅ Combine lists with conditional logic for complex programs

## 🔧 Python Concepts Introduced

### Random Module Functions
```python
import random

# Random integer in range
random.randint(1, 10)      # 1 to 10 inclusive

# Random float
random.random()            # 0.0 to 1.0 (exclusive)
random.uniform(1.5, 10.5)  # Float in range

# Random selection
random.choice([1, 2, 3])   # Pick one item
random.shuffle(my_list)    # Shuffle list in place
```

### List Indexing
```python
my_list = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]

# Positive indexing (from start)
print(my_list[0])    # "a" (first element)
print(my_list[2])    # "c" (third element)

# Negative indexing (from end)
print(my_list[-1])   # "e" (last element)
print(my_list[-2])   # "d" (second to last)
```

### List Slicing
```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Slicing syntax: list[start:end:step]
print(numbers[1:4])    # [1, 2, 3] (elements 1 to 3)
print(numbers[:3])     # [0, 1, 2] (first 3 elements)
print(numbers[3:])     # [3, 4, 5] (from index 3 to end)
print(numbers[::2])    # [0, 2, 4] (every 2nd element)
```

## 💡 Tips and Best Practices

1. **Import Placement**: Put import statements at the top of your file
2. **Random Seed**: Use `random.seed()` for reproducible random sequences (testing)
3. **List Bounds**: Always check list length before accessing elements
4. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive names for lists (e.g., `student_names` not `list1`)
5. **Zero Indexing**: Remember Python lists start at index 0

## 🏆 Challenges

Try these additional challenges to reinforce your learning:

1. **Easy**: Create a random password generator using lists of characters
2. **Medium**: Build a simple slot machine with random symbols
3. **Hard**: Create a random maze generator using nested lists
4. **Expert**: Build a card shuffling and dealing system

## 🔍 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **IndexError**: Trying to access an index that doesn't exist
2. **Off-by-One Errors**: Forgetting that lists start at index 0
3. **Modifying Lists During Iteration**: Can cause unexpected behavior
4. **Forgetting to Import**: Must import random module before using it
5. **List vs String Confusion**: Lists use square brackets, strings use quotes

## 📖 Key Functions and Methods

### Random Module:
- `random.randint(a, b)` - Random integer between a and b (inclusive)
- `random.random()` - Random float between 0 and 1
- `random.choice(sequence)` - Random element from sequence
- `random.shuffle(list)` - Shuffle list in place

### List Methods:
- `list.append(item)` - Add item to end
- `list.insert(index, item)` - Insert item at index
- `list.remove(item)` - Remove first occurrence of item
- `list.pop(index)` - Remove and return item at index
- `len(list)` - Get list length
