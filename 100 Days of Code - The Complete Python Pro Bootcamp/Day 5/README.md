### Main Project:
🔐 **[Password Generator Project](./Password%20Generator%20Project/)** - Create secure random passwords with customizable length and character types

## 🎮 Password Generator Project

The Day 5 capstone project is a secure password generator that:
- Allows users to specify password length requirements
- Includes letters, numbers, and symbols
- Uses loops to build passwords character by character
- Shuffles characters for better security
- Demonstrates practical application of loops and randomization

### Project Features:
- Customizable number of letters, symbols, and numbers
- Random selection from character pools
- Password shuffling for enhanced security
- User-friendly input prompts
- Secure password generation

### Sample Interaction:
```
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
> 4
How many symbols would you like?
> 2
How many numbers would you like?
> 2
Your password is: g$f3h7!k
```

## 🧠 Key Programming Concepts

### Basic For Loop Structure
```python
# Iterating through a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Iterating through a string
for letter in "Python":
    print(letter)
```

### For Loops with Range
```python
# Basic range - numbers 0 to 4
for number in range(5):
    print(number)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

# Range with start and stop
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)  # Prints 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

# Range with step
for number in range(0, 11, 2):
    print(number)  # Prints 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

### Accumulator Pattern
```python
# Sum all numbers in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = 0
for number in numbers:
    total += number
print(f"Total: {total}")  # Total: 15

# Find maximum value
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
highest = 0
for score in scores:
    if score > highest:
        highest = score
print(f"Highest score: {highest}")
```

### Nested Loops
```python
# Loop within a loop
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):
        print(f"({i}, {j})")
```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 5, you should be able to:
- ✅ Write and understand for loops
- ✅ Use the range() function effectively
- ✅ Iterate through lists, strings, and number sequences
- ✅ Implement the accumulator pattern
- ✅ Use loops to build and modify data
- ✅ Combine loops with conditional statements
- ✅ Create programs that process collections of data
- ✅ Build practical applications using loops

## 🔧 Python Concepts Introduced

### Range Function Variations
```python
# Different ways to use range()
range(5)           # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(2, 8)        # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
range(0, 10, 2)    # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
range(10, 0, -1)   # 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### Loop Control Flow
```python
# Continue - skip current iteration
for number in range(10):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(number)  # Only prints odd numbers

# Break - exit loop early
for number in range(10):
    if number == 5:
        break  # Stop when we reach 5
    print(number)  # Prints 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### List Comprehensions (Preview)
```python
# Traditional loop
squares = []
for x in range(5):
    squares.append(x ** 2)

# List comprehension (more advanced)
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(5)]
```

## 💡 Tips and Best Practices

1. **Meaningful Variable Names**: Use descriptive names for loop variables
2. **Avoid Modifying Lists**: Don't change a list while iterating through it
3. **Range Efficiency**: Use range() instead of creating large lists
4. **Loop Planning**: Think about what you want to accomplish before writing the loop
5. **Testing**: Test loops with small datasets first

## 🏆 Challenges

Try these additional challenges to reinforce your learning:

1. **Easy**: Create a multiplication table generator
2. **Medium**: Build a simple text-based progress bar
3. **Hard**: Create a pattern printer that draws shapes with asterisks
4. **Expert**: Build a prime number generator using loops

## 🔍 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Infinite Loops**: Make sure loop conditions will eventually be false
2. **Off-by-One Errors**: Remember range(5) gives 0-4, not 1-5
3. **Modifying During Iteration**: Don't change a list while looping through it
4. **Indentation**: Keep loop body properly indented
5. **Variable Scope**: Loop variables exist outside the loop after completion

## 📖 Key Functions and Concepts

### Loop Keywords:
- `for` - Start a for loop
- `in` - Membership operator for iteration
- `range()` - Generate number sequences
- `break` - Exit loop early
- `continue` - Skip to next iteration

### Range Function:
- `range(stop)` - Numbers from 0 to stop-1
- `range(start, stop)` - Numbers from start to stop-1
- `range(start, stop, step)` - Numbers with custom step size

### Common Patterns:
- **Accumulator**: Building up a result over iterations
- **Counter**: Counting occurrences or iterations
- **Filter**: Processing only certain elements
- **Transform**: Converting each element
