# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my journey through the **100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu! This repository contains all my code, projects, and learning progress as I work through this comprehensive Python course.

## 📚 Course Overview

This bootcamp covers Python programming from beginner to advanced levels, with hands-on projects and real-world applications. The course is designed to take you from zero programming experience to being able to build your own programs and even get hired as a Python developer.
