# Calculator Project üßÆ

A fully functional calculator program with continuous operation capabilities and ASCII art interface.

## üìñ Project Description

This is the **Day 10** project from the 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations and allows users to continue calculations with previous results or start fresh calculations.

## üéÆ How to Use

1. Enter the first number
2. Choose an operation (+, -, *, /)
3. Enter the second number
4. View the result
5. Choose to continue with the result or start a new calculation
6. Type 'n' to start over or 'y' to continue with the current result

## üöÄ How to Run

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp/Day 10/Calculator Project"

# Run the calculator
python main.py
```

## üìÅ Project Files

- **`main.py`** - Main calculator logic and user interaction
- **`art.py`** - ASCII art logo for the calculator
- **`solution.py`** - Complete solution reference

## üé® Features

- **Four Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- **Continuous Calculation**: Use previous results for new calculations
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid operations gracefully
- **Clean Interface**: ASCII art logo and clear prompts
- **Memory Function**: Remembers the last result for continued operations

## üß† Programming Concepts Demonstrated

- **Functions with Return Values**: Creating functions that output results
- **Dictionaries**: Storing functions as values with operation symbols as keys
- **Function References**: Storing and calling functions from a dictionary
- **Recursion**: The calculator can call itself for continuous operation
- **Input Validation**: Checking for valid operations
- **Program Flow Control**: Managing different calculation paths

## üéØ Calculator Operations

```python
operations = {
    "+": add,
    "-": subtract,
    "*": multiply,
    "/": divide,
}
```

### Supported Operations:
- **Addition (+)**: Adds two numbers
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts second number from first
- **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two numbers
- **Division (/)**: Divides first number by second

## üìù Sample Usage

What's the first number?: 15
Pick an operation: +
What's the next number?: 7
15 + 7 = 22

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 22, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: y
Pick an operation: *
What's the next number?: 3
22 * 3 = 66

Type 'y' to continue calculating with 66, or type 'n' to start a new calculation: n
```

## üîß Code Structure

### Main Functions:
```python
def add(n1, n2):
    """Add two numbers"""
    return n1 + n2

def subtract(n1, n2):
    """Subtract n2 from n1"""
    return n1 - n2

def multiply(n1, n2):
    """Multiply two numbers"""
    return n1 * n2

def divide(n1, n2):
    """Divide n1 by n2"""
    return n1 / n2
```

### Dictionary of Operations:
```python
operations = {
    "+": add,
    "-": subtract,
    "*": multiply,
    "/": divide,
}
```

## üéì Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you'll understand:

- **Functions with Return Values**: How to create functions that return results
- **Dictionary Usage**: Storing functions as dictionary values
- **Function References**: Calling functions stored in data structures
- **Program Flow**: Managing different execution paths
- **User Experience**: Creating intuitive interfaces for programs
- **Code Organization**: Structuring programs with multiple functions

## üèÜ Challenges

Try these extensions to enhance your learning:

1. **Easy**: Add more operations (power, square root, modulo)
2. **Medium**: Implement memory functions (store, recall, clear)
3. **Hard**: Add support for multiple operations in one line (e.g., "5 + 3 * 2")
4. **Expert**: Create a graphical calculator interface using Tkinter

## üîç Key Programming Concepts

### Function Storage in Dictionaries
```python
# Instead of using if/elif chains:
if operation == "+":
    result = add(n1, n2)
elif operation == "-":
    result = subtract(n1, n2)

# Use dictionary lookup:
result = operations[operation](n1, n2)
```

### Recursive Program Flow
The calculator can call itself to start new calculations while maintaining clean code structure.
