## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### Main Project:
‚òï **[Coffee Machine Project](./Coffee%20Machine%20Project/)** - Complete coffee vending machine simulation with inventory, payments, and multiple drink options

## üéÆ Coffee Machine Project

The Day 15 capstone project is a comprehensive coffee machine simulator that:
- Manages water, milk, coffee, and money resources
- Offers three different coffee drinks with unique recipes
- Processes coin payments and calculates change
- Provides maintenance reports and machine control
- Demonstrates professional-level program organization

### Machine Features:
- **Three Drink Options**: Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino
- **Resource Management**: Water, milk, coffee beans, money
- **Payment Processing**: Quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies
- **Change Calculation**: Returns exact change when overpaid
- **Inventory Checking**: Prevents orders when resources insufficient
- **Admin Functions**: Report command shows current resources
- **Machine Control**: Off command shuts down machine

### Coffee Recipes:
- **Espresso**: 50ml water, 18g coffee - $1.50
- **Latte**: 200ml water, 150ml milk, 24g coffee - $2.50
- **Cappuccino**: 250ml water, 100ml milk, 24g coffee - $3.00

### Sample Interaction:
```
What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): latte
Please insert coins.
How many quarters?: 10
How many dimes?: 0
How many nickels?: 0
How many pennies?: 0
Here is $0.00 in change.
Here is your latte ‚òïÔ∏è. Enjoy!

What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): report
Water: 50ml
Milk: 350ml
Coffee: 76g
Money: $2.50

What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): cappuccino
Sorry there is not enough water.

What would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): off
```

## üß† Key Programming Concepts

### Resource Management System
```python
MENU = {
    "espresso": {
        "ingredients": {
            "water": 50,
            "coffee": 18,
        },
        "cost": 1.5,
    },
    "latte": {
        "ingredients": {
            "water": 200,
            "milk": 150,
            "coffee": 24,
        },
        "cost": 2.5,
    },
    "cappuccino": {
        "ingredients": {
            "water": 250,
            "milk": 100,
            "coffee": 24,
        },
        "cost": 3.0,
    }
}

resources = {
    "water": 300,
    "milk": 200,
    "coffee": 100,
}
```

### Resource Checking Logic
```python
def is_resource_sufficient(order_ingredients):
    """Returns True when order can be made, False if ingredients are insufficient."""
    for item in order_ingredients:
        if order_ingredients[item] > resources[item]:
            print(f"‚ÄãSorry there is not enough {item}.")
            return False
    return True
```

### Payment Processing System
```python
def process_coins():
    """Returns the total calculated from coins inserted."""
    print("Please insert coins.")
    total = int(input("How many quarters?: ")) * 0.25
    total += int(input("How many dimes?: ")) * 0.1
    total += int(input("How many nickels?: ")) * 0.05
    total += int(input("How many pennies?: ")) * 0.01
    return total

def is_transaction_successful(money_received, drink_cost):
    """Return True when the payment is accepted, or False if money is insufficient."""
    if money_received >= drink_cost:
        change = round(money_received - drink_cost, 2)
        print(f"Here is ${change} in change.")
        global profit
        profit += drink_cost
        return True
    else:
        print("Sorry that's not enough money. Money refunded.")
        return False
```

### Coffee Making Process
```python
def make_coffee(drink_name, order_ingredients):
    """Deduct the required ingredients from the resources."""
    for item in order_ingredients:
        resources[item] -= order_ingredients[item]
    print(f"Here is your {drink_name} ‚òïÔ∏è. Enjoy!")
```

### Main Program Loop
```python
is_on = True

while is_on:
    choice = input("‚ÄãWhat would you like? (espresso/latte/cappuccino): ")
    if choice == "off":
        is_on = False
    elif choice == "report":
        print(f"Water: {resources['water']}ml")
        print(f"Milk: {resources['milk']}ml")
        print(f"Coffee: {resources['coffee']}g")
        print(f"Money: ${profit}")
    else:
        drink = MENU[choice]
        if is_resource_sufficient(drink["ingredients"]):
            payment = process_coins()
            if is_transaction_successful(payment, drink["cost"]):
                make_coffee(choice, drink["ingredients"])
```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 15, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Design and implement complex program architectures
- ‚úÖ Manage multiple types of resources and state
- ‚úÖ Process monetary transactions with precision
- ‚úÖ Create professional user interfaces
- ‚úÖ Implement comprehensive error checking
- ‚úÖ Organize code into logical, maintainable functions
- ‚úÖ Handle edge cases and invalid inputs
- ‚úÖ Build real-world applicable software systems

## üîß Advanced Programming Concepts

### Data Structure Design
```python
# Nested dictionaries for complex data organization
MENU = {
    "drink_name": {
        "ingredients": {
            "resource": amount,
        },
        "cost": price,
    }
}

# Global state management
resources = {}
profit = 0
```

### Function Organization
```python
# Separation of concerns - each function has one responsibility
def report()           # Display current status
def check_resources()  # Validate sufficient ingredients
def process_payment()  # Handle money transactions
def make_coffee()      # Execute drink preparation
def main()            # Control program flow
```

### Error Handling and Validation
```python
def safe_input_validation(prompt, valid_options):
    """Get user input and validate against allowed options"""
    while True:
        user_input = input(prompt).lower()
        if user_input in valid_options:
            return user_input
        print(f"Invalid option. Please choose from: {valid_options}")

def validate_coin_input(coin_type):
    """Ensure coin input is a valid number"""
    while True:
        try:
            count = int(input(f"How many {coin_type}?: "))
            if count >= 0:
                return count
            print("Please enter a non-negative number.")
        except ValueError:
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

## üí° Professional Development Tips

1. **Planning First**: Design your program structure before coding
2. **Modular Functions**: Each function should have a single, clear purpose
3. **Data Organization**: Use appropriate data structures for your needs
4. **Error Prevention**: Check for problems before they occur
5. **User Experience**: Make your program intuitive and helpful

## üèÜ Challenges and Extensions

Enhance your coffee machine with these features:

1. **Easy**: Add a "refill" command to restock resources
2. **Medium**: Implement different cup sizes (small, medium, large)
3. **Hard**: Add a maintenance mode with cleaning cycles
4. **Expert**: Create a GUI version using Tkinter

## üîç Real-World Applications

This project demonstrates concepts used in:
- **Vending Machine Software**: Resource management and payments
- **Point of Sale Systems**: Transaction processing and inventory
- **ATM Software**: User interface and transaction handling
- **Inventory Management**: Resource tracking and alerts
- **E-commerce**: Payment processing and order fulfillment

## üìñ Software Engineering Principles

### Design Patterns Applied:
- **State Management**: Tracking machine resources and status
- **Command Pattern**: Different user commands trigger different actions
- **Validation Pattern**: Checking conditions before executing actions
- **Transaction Pattern**: Ensuring payment before product delivery

### Code Quality Principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function does one thing well
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reusable functions for common operations
- **Clear Naming**: Function and variable names explain their purpose
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of edge cases
