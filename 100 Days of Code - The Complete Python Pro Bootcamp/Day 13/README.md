### Main Focus:
üîß **Debugging Practice** - Multiple broken programs to fix using different debugging techniques

## üêõ Common Types of Errors

### 1. Syntax Errors
```python
# Missing colon
if age >= 18
    print("You can vote")

# Incorrect indentation
def my_function():
print("Hello")

# Mismatched parentheses
print("Hello World"
```

### 2. Logic Errors
```python
# Wrong comparison operator
age = 18
if age > 18:  # Should be >= 18
    print("You can vote")

# Off-by-one error
for i in range(len(my_list) + 1):  # Will cause IndexError
    print(my_list[i])

# Wrong variable name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello {username}")  # Should be user_name
```

### 3. Runtime Errors
```python
# Division by zero
result = 10 / 0

# Index out of range
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list[5])

# Key error in dictionary
my_dict = {"name": "John"}
print(my_dict["age"])
```

## üîß Debugging Techniques

### 1. Read Error Messages Carefully
```python
# Error message example:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 5, in <module>
#     print(my_list[10])
# IndexError: list index out of range

# The error tells you:
# - File name: main.py
# - Line number: 5
# - Error type: IndexError
# - Description: list index out of range
```

### 2. Use Print Statements for Debugging
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    print(f"Input numbers: {numbers}")  # Debug: Check input
    
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        print(f"Adding {num}, total so far: {total}")  # Debug: Track progress
        total += num
    
    average = total / len(numbers)
    print(f"Final total: {total}, count: {len(numbers)}, average: {average}")  # Debug: Check calculation
    
    return average
```

### 3. Rubber Duck Debugging
```python
# Explain your code line by line to a rubber duck (or anyone)
# This often helps you spot the problem yourself

def find_maximum(numbers):
    # "I'm creating a function to find the maximum number"
    max_num = 0  # "I set max_num to 0 initially"
    # Wait... what if all numbers are negative? This is the bug!
    
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    
    return max_num

# Fixed version:
def find_maximum(numbers):
    max_num = numbers[0]  # Start with first number instead of 0
    for num in numbers[1:]:  # Check remaining numbers
        if num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```

### 4. Binary Search Debugging
```python
# Comment out half of your code to isolate the problem
def complex_function():
    # Step 1: Data preparation
    data = prepare_data()
    
    # Step 2: Processing
    # processed = process_data(data)  # Comment this out
    
    # Step 3: Output
    # return format_output(processed)  # Comment this out
    
    return data  # Test if Step 1 works first
```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of Day 13, you should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Read and understand Python error messages
- ‚úÖ Identify different types of errors (syntax, logic, runtime)
- ‚úÖ Use systematic approaches to find bugs
- ‚úÖ Apply debugging techniques effectively
- ‚úÖ Use print statements strategically for debugging
- ‚úÖ Trace through code execution mentally
- ‚úÖ Fix common programming errors
- ‚úÖ Develop debugging mindset and patience

## üîç Debugging Strategies

### The Scientific Method for Debugging:
1. **Observe** - What is the actual behavior?
2. **Hypothesize** - What might be causing it?
3. **Test** - Try a fix or gather more information
4. **Analyze** - Did the test confirm or refute your hypothesis?
5. **Repeat** - Continue until the bug is fixed

### Systematic Debugging Process:
```python
# 1. Reproduce the bug consistently
# 2. Isolate the problem area
# 3. Check your assumptions
# 4. Use debugging tools
# 5. Fix one thing at a time
# 6. Test your fix thoroughly
```

## üí° Debugging Tips and Best Practices

1. **Stay Calm**: Debugging is a normal part of programming
2. **Read Carefully**: Error messages contain valuable information
3. **Start Simple**: Check the obvious things first
4. **One Change at a Time**: Don't fix multiple things simultaneously
5. **Test Frequently**: Run your code often to catch errors early
6. **Use Version Control**: Keep working versions of your code
7. **Take Breaks**: Fresh eyes often spot problems more easily

## üèÜ Advanced Debugging Techniques

### 1. Logging Instead of Print
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def my_function(x, y):
    logging.debug(f"Function called with x={x}, y={y}")
    result = x + y
    logging.debug(f"Result calculated: {result}")
    return result
```

### 2. Exception Handling
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"ValueError occurred: {e}")
    # Handle the error appropriately
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    # Log the error for investigation
```

### 3. Assertions for Testing Assumptions
```python
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Division by zero is not allowed"
    assert isinstance(a, (int, float)), "First argument must be a number"
    assert isinstance(b, (int, float)), "Second argument must be a number"
    
    return a / b
```

## üîß Common Error Patterns and Solutions

### IndexError Solutions:
```python
# Problem: Accessing list index that doesn't exist
# Solution: Check list length or use try/except

# Safe list access
if index < len(my_list):
    value = my_list[index]
else:
    print("Index out of range")
```

### KeyError Solutions:
```python
# Problem: Accessing dictionary key that doesn't exist
# Solution: Use .get() method or check if key exists

# Safe dictionary access
value = my_dict.get('key', 'default_value')
# or
if 'key' in my_dict:
    value = my_dict['key']
```

### Logic Error Prevention:
```python
# Use meaningful variable names
is_adult = age >= 18  # Clear boolean variable
if is_adult:
    print("Can vote")

# Add comments for complex logic
# Check if user is eligible (18+ and registered)
if age >= 18 and is_registered:
    allow_voting()
```
